COM_FOCALPOINT_INSTALL_V12_NOTICE = "FocalPoint v1.2 included a new batch of icon markers and cluster icons. Since you are upgrading to Shack Locations from an earlier version, these markers cannot be moved to your images folder without overwriting the original images/markers directory which we do not wish to do. The new markers can be found on your server in the media/com_focalpoint folder. Alternatively, you can extract the installation archive on your local machine where you can find the markers in the media folder. You are free to use these new markers as you wish. There are over 200 of them. You can upload or move them via FTP or through your hosting control panel. For new installations, the new markers have been moved to images/markers."
